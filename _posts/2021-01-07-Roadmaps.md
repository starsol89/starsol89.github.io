# Developer Roadmaps!

First of all, Happy New Year.

Thank you for coming to see me like this.

This data summarizes some of the short knowledge I know.

I hope it helps.

I found more up-to-date information, but I couldn't find it. I think it's hard to find it because I'm not good at English. I'm sorry.

This road map doesn't tell you everything.

What's really important is to read each of the required descriptions.

The technical document you want to learn is well organized by document.

for example,

<a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide">Python Document</a>

This is the Python official document.

It's documented for those who want to learn, and we can use it to learn.

It's not complete, but it's a site that summarizes some language characteristics.

I hope it helps. ---> <a href="https://www.eligo.co.uk/blog/2017/03/how-to-choose-a-programming-language-thats-right-for-you">characteristics of languages</a>

## This is the order of study I think.

1. Set the desired developer area.
2. Examine me to learn the basic courses in the areas I've decided from start to finish.
   - Take an online class that aims to boot camp or clone coding for the selected language.
3. Then look at the official documentation about the technology and think again.
   - You can better understand the functions, variables, and structure you just performed.
4. It's good to make small things that you want to make yourself.
   - TODO_list or Calculator
5. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> --> Ask people what they don't know. Developers or people who study with them answer.
6. Then create your own little toy project and create a portfolio.

To be honest, I'm staying in District 3.

I say I study whenever I have time, but it's not easy.

Please let me know if you have any questions while studying.

I'll do my best to tell you what I know.

And once again, thank you for your interest in me.
