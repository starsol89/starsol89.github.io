# Developer Roadmaps!

First of all, Happy New Year.

Thank you for coming to see me like this.

This data summarizes some of the short knowledge I know.

I hope it helps.

I found more up-to-date information, but I couldn't find it. I think it's hard to find it because I'm not good at English. I'm sorry.

This road map doesn't tell you everything.

What's really important is to read each of the required descriptions.

The technical document you want to learn is well organized by document.

for example,

<a href=https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide>Python Document</a>

This is the Python official document.

It's documented for those who want to learn, and we can use it to learn.

It's not complete, but it's a site that summarizes some language characteristics.

I hope it helps. ---> <a href=https://www.eligo.co.uk/blog/2017/03/how-to-choose-a-programming-language-thats-right-for-you>characteristics of languages</a>
